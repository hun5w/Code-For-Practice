/*Problem Description
John has n points on the X axis, and their coordinates are (x[i],0),(i=0,1,2,…,n−1). He wants to know how many pairs<a,b> that |x[b]−x[a]|≤k.(a<b)
 

Input
The first line contains a single integer T (about 5), indicating the number of cases.
Each test case begins with two integers n,k(1≤n≤100000,1≤k≤109).
Next n lines contain an integer x[i](−109≤x[i]≤109), means the X coordinates.
 

Output
For each case, output an integer means how many pairs<a,b> that |x[b]−x[a]|≤k.*/
